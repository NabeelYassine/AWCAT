      <p>Paulo Coelho is unquestionably one of the most successful authors of all time. In fact, he is the best selling Portuguese language author in history. With more than 100 million books sold in at least 150 countries all across the world, Coelho has met with a lot of success.  His books have been widely translated into a number of languages, earning him the prestigious Guinness World Record for the most translated book by a living author.</p>

      <h1 class="w3-text-teal">Early Life</h1>
      <p>Paulo Coelho was born on August 24, 1947, in Brazil.</p>
<p>	  Coelho was raised in Rio de Janeiro. He rebelled against the conventions of his Roman Catholic upbringing and, as a result, was temporarily committed to a psychiatric hospital by his parents. Coelho dropped out of law school in 1970 and traveled through South America, Mexico, North Africa, and Europe. In 1972 he returned home and began writing pop and rock music lyrics with Raul Seixas, a well-known Brazilian singer and songwriter. In 1974 Coelho was briefly imprisoned for alleged subversive activities against the Brazilian government.</p>
<p>After his release he worked for Polygram and CBS Records until 1980, when he embarked on new travels in Europe and Africa. It was during this trip that he walked the route of Santiago de Compostela, some 500 miles (800 km) of roads first used during the Middle Ages by pilgrims traveling from France to Spain. This extensive journey, inflected by a renewed interest in Catholicism, formed the basis of his first book, O diário de um mago (1987), which was published in English as The Diary of a Magus in 1992 and was reissued as The Pilgrimage in 1995.</p>

      <h1 class="w3-text-teal">Career</h1>
      <p>In 1988, Coelho published <em>O Alquimista</em> (The Alchemist), a mystical account of an Andalusian shepherd boy’s journey across North Africa in search of treasure. After being dropped by its first publisher, the book was reissued to great success in Brazil and—in translation—abroad. His memoir <em>As Valkírias</em> (1992; The Valkyries) recounts a quest to speak with angels, undertaken with his first wife during their youthful immersion in the countercultural milieu of the 1970s. He again turned to fiction with <em>Na Margem do Rio Piedra Eu Sentei e Chorei</em> (1994; By the River Piedra I Sat Down and Wept), which concerns the spiritual reawakening of a young Spanish woman.</p>
    <p>Coelho continued to center both his fiction and non-fiction works on questions of faith and spirituality. <em>Manual do Guerreiro da Luz</em> (1997; Manual of the Warrior of Light) couches a selection of spiritual exhortations from well-known religious figures in a fictional framework. Though Coelho’s novels continued to succeed both in Brazil and abroad, critics often characterized them as overly didactic and moralizing.
